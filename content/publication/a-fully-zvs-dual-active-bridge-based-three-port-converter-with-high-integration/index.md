abstract: A novel dual-active-bridge based three-port con- verter (TPC) is
  proposed for islanded dc microgrids. The pro- posed converter can interface
  among three ports (PV source, battery, and dc-link) simultaneously with high
  integration. Rechargeable battery operates as an energy buffer to compensate
  for power mismatch between PV source and dc-link. Electric power can flow
  bi-directionally between the battery and dc-link. Pulse-width-modulation (PWM)
  on the primary side is utilized to realize the maximum power point tracking
  (MPPT) of PV panel. An optimized phase-shift-modulation (PSM) is introduced to
  regulate power flow, ensure ZVS among all MOSFETs and reduce circulating
  current over a wide range. To verify this concept, a 500 W rated prototype is
  designed. The designed prototype exhibits high efficiency in various operating
  modes. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis.

summary: In this paper, a partially isolated bi-directional TPC with PWM and PSM
  hybrid modulation scheme is proposed. Six operating modes of the TPC can be
  classified due to mul- tifunctional application. The operating principles and
  theo- retical analysis are detailed. Optimal design considerations are
  discussed to ensure secure ZVS over a wide range. The parameters of the
  converter are optimized to reduce the reactive power, which helps to enhance
  efficiency. Finally, a 500W rated prototype is tested to verify the proof of
  concept. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effective- ness
  of the proposed topology and modulation scheme.
